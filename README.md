# spring-admisson
This was a group project where we made the user, and admin, side of the Base Camp Coding Academy's student application form.

# The User Side
This side of the application is what everyone will see when they load up the website. The purpose of this application is to allow an user to apply for next years class. They first will see the home page which gives them an overview of what BCCA is, and they will see a picture of the current students. From there they can click the apply link which will take them to a form. Once they fill out the form they can submit it which will then enter it into a database.

# The Admin Side
This side will not be seen by the outside users; however, an admin will be able to look at all of the forms that have been saved to the database. We they first open the application they will see a list of all the applications that they can then filter and search through. They can also click on any of them to read more of the application itself.
